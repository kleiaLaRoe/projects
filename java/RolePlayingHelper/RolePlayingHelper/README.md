This project aims to make life a little easier for Dungeon Masters by taking out all of the math and calculations of creating a monster or NPC. I've read the 5e DM's guide, and understand how messy those tables can get. The goal is to allow for a DM to input values for a monster to either determine the level or CR of a monster based on the roleplaying system being used. At this moment, I am only creating this for Dungeon and Dragons 5th edition and Pathfinder 2nd edition. I have hopes to expand this and allow for other systems to also generate monster, and to possibly translate stats from one system to another.
