    "Set location of data for cases collected by WHO for cases and deaths worldwide as well as data that has been collected for the United States. Goal will be to observe and compare the differences amongst a group of 10 countries (United States, Japan, China, Germany, South Korea, England, Spain, Italy, Iran, and Sweden/Switzerland) to each other and compare each state. The goal is to have a visible representation of the effects of the virus and compare how it has been handled across different governments with the amount of time they had to react. To pull and use the data that will be displayed in the following sections, please see README for the John Hopkins University data repository."
